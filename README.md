### Website structure
The Website will have a non-linear hiperlinked structure. A navigation bar will be in the header providing links to the different menu pages, the Wine List, The gallery Page, and the contact form.  
In the mobile devices the navigation bar will collapse into a toggler menu(burger icon) taking less real estate space and allow the home page to be a bit lighter and not too busy.
Each page will keep the same header and footer.  
The homepage main section will have a full image on the background with some windows opening on the side with Special Offers, Take Away message and dietary friendly spot. In the Mobile devices the messages will take the full width of the screen keeping the picture in the background. Under the hero picture three column will contain reviews of different customers. Again in the mobile view the reviews will display in a single column for the full width of the screen.  
In the Gallery Page the pictures will flow in the same scren one below the other, and that will be the same for the smaller devices and tablet.   
The menu pages will have the same body structure and colors, changing only the content, providing consistance and repetition thorough the website. A download button will be dispayed just below the navbar, giving the user the choice for dowload the PDF menu.
