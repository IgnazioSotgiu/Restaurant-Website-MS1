### Website structure

The Website have a non-linear hyperlinked structure. A navigation bar in the header provide links to the different Menu Pages, the Wine List, The Gallery Page, and the Contact Form.  
In the mobile devices the navigation bar is collapsed into a toggle menu taking less real estate space and allow the home page to be a bit lighter and not too busy.
Each page has the same header and footer making the website more intuitiveand user friendly.  
The homepage main specials section have a full image on the background with some messages opening on the side with Special  Sunday Offers, Pre-teathre  and Take Away deals. In the Mobile devices the messages  take the full width of the screen keeping the picture in the background. In desktop screens at the bottom of the main picture three columns contain reviews of different customers. In the tablet screen only 2 reviews are displayed inline. In the mobile view the reviews are in a single column for the full width of the screen.  
In the Gallery Page the pictures will flow in the same screen one below the other and that will be the same for the smaller devices and tablet.   
All the menu pages have the same body structure and colours, changing only the content, providing consistence and repetition thorough the website. A download button is present just below the menu title, giving the user the choice for download a printable copy of the menu.
